PREDICTE CREDIT CARD APPROVAL USING ML.

Why is your proposal important in today’s world? How predicting a good client is worthy for a bank?

A) The proposal to predict credit card approval is highly relevant in today's world due to the increasing use of credit cards as a financial tool. With the rise in e-commerce and online transactions, credit cards have become a primary payment method for many individuals, making it essential for banks to efficiently process credit card applications and improve the approval rate. Predicting a good client is essential for a bank because it helps to minimize the risk of credit default and reduce the cost of managing credit card accounts. Banks can use machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors such as income level, employment status etc. By accurately predicting, banks can offer credit cards to clients with lower risk profiles, which can ultimately lead to better profitability and improved customer satisfaction.

How is it going to impact the banking sector?

A) predicting credit card approval using machine learning can have a transformative impact on the banking sector by improving the customer experience, reducing risk, and increasing profitability. Improved customer experience: By using predictive models, banks can offer faster and more accurate credit card approvals, which can improve the overall customer experience. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Reduced risk of credit defaults: Machine learning algorithms can help banks to accurately predict the likelihood of a client defaulting on their credit card payments. By identifying clients with lower credit risk profiles, banks can offer credit cards with lower interest rates, which can reduce the risk of defaults and ultimately improve the bank's profitability. Improved profitability: By reducing the risk of credit defaults and improving the efficiency of the underwriting process, banks can increase their profitability. This can help banks to offer better rates and benefits to their clients, leading to increased market share and revenue.

If any, what is the gap in the knowledge or how your proposed method can be helpful if required in future for any bank in India ?

A) If there is a gap in the knowledge or process used by a bank in India for credit card approval, the proposed method can be helpful for banks in India by improving the accuracy of credit card approval predictions, enhancing credit risk management strategies, and improving efficiency. However, to fully leverage the benefits of our proposed method, banks will need to ensure that they have access to reliable and comprehensive data sources.

Project Overview

This research is focusing on application of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict customer eligibility for a credit card. Credit Risk: Defined as the potential loss to the bank if a borrower fails to meet obligations. Critical in loan decisions to reduce the probability of non-performing assets (NPA). There are several manual steps involving when granting a credit card to a customer. Assessing applicant’s creditworthiness and checking the eligibility are the key factors and decisions the bank would take about a credit worthiness will not always be accurate. Application of machine learning techniques can eliminate manual paperwork, time-consuming processes and most importantly data driven decision making before granting a credit card to a customer. In this research, different supervised machine learning algorithms were used to develop models and follow the steps in cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) life cycle. Accuracy of models was validated by using different validation techniques.

Systamatic approach:

the Cross-Industry Standard Process (CRISP-DM):

Business Understanding: Identify business objectives and goals. Define the problem and formulate relevant questions. Establish success criteria and constraints. Understand the context and requirements of the project.

Data Understanding: Collect and explore available data sources. Assess data quality and completeness. Summarize and visualize data to gain insights. Identify potential data issues and challenges.

Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the data. Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Transform variables and features for modeling. Create derived features and engineer new variables. Split data into training and testing sets.

Modeling: Select appropriate modeling techniques. Train models using the training dataset. Optimize and fine-tune model parameters. Validate models using the testing dataset. Compare and evaluate different models.

Evaluation: Assess model performance against success criteria. Use relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score). Consider the impact of false positives and false negatives. Validate models with stakeholders. Iterate on the modeling process if needed.

Deployment: Implement and integrate the selected model into operational systems. Monitor model performance in real-world scenarios. Develop documentation for end-users and stakeholders. Communicate findings and insights to relevant teams. Plan for ongoing maintenance and model updates.

FINAL RESULTS OF MODELS ACCURACY:
